I want to create a Jetpack Compose app that:

Records audio using the phone's microphone.
Displays real-time decibel levels, updating every second in live mode.
Follows best UI principles with a modern and visually appealing UI.
Uses a clean architecture with separate classes for different responsibilities.
Follows an appropriate design pattern (e.g., MVVM).
Requests microphone permission and handles permission states properly.


Step-by-Step Requirements
Request Audio Recording Permission in a user-friendly way.
Create a Compose UI that shows a live decibel meter, updating every second.
Implement an Audio Recorder class to capture microphone input.
Process the audio input and compute decibel levels dynamically.
Use a ViewModel to manage audio data and UI state.
Ensure proper lifecycle management (start/stop recording correctly).
Follow best practices for Jetpack Compose and clean architecture.
